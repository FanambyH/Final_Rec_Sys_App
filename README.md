# Emotion-based music recommendation system
The purpose of this project is to recommend the most suitable top k songs to the user from a given playlist, based on previous recordings of his feelings. It is a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based project which uses the music emotions and genre added to the user information (mainly his age, mood, and gender) as state features, and a reward system based on the userâ€™s feeling, namely his stress level detected from his Heart Rate Variability (HRV).
